  - The Land: Swarm (Book 3)
  - The Land: Alliances (Book 4)
  - The Land: Raiders (Book 5)
  - Plus additional books in series

### Discworld Series (Terry Pratchett)
- 9 of 30 books currently owned
- Large opportunity to complete - 21 books missing
- Collection shows good representation but significant gaps
