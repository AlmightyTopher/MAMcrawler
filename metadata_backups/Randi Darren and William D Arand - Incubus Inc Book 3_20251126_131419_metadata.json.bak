  "description": "Sameerixis, or Sam for those who actually know him, isn’t what you’d call normal.\n He had been a door-to-door salesman, of sorts.\n One that peddled wares, wishes, and whims to anyone willing to pay his prices.\n Except that life is gone now.\n His old business model had been modernized. Email, phone contacts, letters, flyers, business cards, and scheduled consultations.\n Sam was a man trapped in place by his own success.\n And loving it.\n Additionally, he was also the owner of a private military company that specialized in dealing with criminals or those wanted by a government.\n His goals were simple. Rebuilding his strength, establishing a comfortable life for himself and others, and taking from Jenaphila as much as he could.\n Now, though, he’s gotten exactly what he wanted in the worst possible way.\n Jenaphila front and center with as much of her empire as he can grab. While she goes after him directly and with vengeance.\n Everything is changing faster than Sam would like it to. Heading right toward what might just be the end of the prime plane itself.",
