You are reviewing the MAMcrawler repo. Your task is to fix one specific bug:

❗ Problem:
The ingest.py and watcher.py pipelines crash with:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff

This happens because files inside guides_output may be saved in UTF-16 or contain a Byte Order Mark (BOM), usually 0xFF 0xFE. The pipeline assumes UTF-8, so decoding fails.

🎯 Goal:
Modify the project so that ingest.py and watcher.py can safely read any Markdown file regardless of encoding. If a file is UTF-16, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-8-BOM, or contains a stray BOM, the system should still read the text correctly.

📌 Requirements:
1. Add a unified file-reading helper in mamcrawler/utils, for example:
   - safe_read_markdown(path: str) -> str
2. The helper must automatically:
   - Detect encoding
   - Remove BOM if present
   - Fallback gracefully on decode errors
3. Update ingest.py and watcher.py to use safe_read_markdown instead of direct open(..., "r") calls.
4. Do NOT modify anything else unrelated to this bug.
5. Produce clean, minimal diffs that do not alter logic outside file-reading.
6. Ensure the fix works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

🧪 Acceptance:
Running:
    python ingest.py
must not error on files containing bytes:
    FF FE, FE FF, EF BB BF
and must process guides_output/* normally.

Now generate the full patch: file additions, file edits, and updated imports.
