## What's Still Missing (9 titles - 34.6%)

These titles had **zero audiobook matches** in Prowlarr despite multiple variation attempts:

### Series with Gaps
1. **Fostering Faust: Compilation: Rebirth** (series compilation)
2. **Incubus Inc III** (book 3 - found in general search but no exact match)

4. **Remnant: Compilation: The Road To Hell** (series compilation)

8. **Wild Wastes Omnibus Edition** (omnibus edition)
9. **Wild Wastes [5/31/2017]** (dated variant)

---

## Key Insights

### What Worked Well
- **Generic series names** (e.g., "Incubus Inc", "Remnant") found multiple books
- **Book numbering variations** (II vs 2, III vs 3) worked for most
- **Adding author name** helped with disambiguation for ambiguous titles
- **High seeder counts** indicate good availability (avg 54 seeders in Round 2)

### What Didn't Work
- **Compilation titles** rarely appeared in Prowlarr index
- **Privateer's Commission series** has zero Prowlarr presence
- **Specific date/year variants** (e.g., "Wild Wastes [5/31/2017]") not indexed
- **Exact title matching** sometimes failed for minor variants

### Recommendations
1. **Privateer's Commission series** - May need manual MAM search or alternative source
2. **Compilation editions** - Often missing from torrent sites; focus on individual books
3. **Remaining variations** - Could try different spelling or search MAM directly
4. **Current status** - Already have 65.4% of Goodreads list available to queue

## Conclusion

Title variation searching proved highly effective, discovering **9 additional Randi Darren titles** not found in initial search. Combined with Round 1 results, now have **17 of 26 titles (65.4%) queued to qBittorrent**. The Prowlarr indexer has good coverage of popular series (Wild Wastes, Fostering Faust, Incubus Inc, Remnant, System Overclocked) but shows gaps for less-distributed titles (Privateer's Commission series entirely missing).

With 13.95 GB of audiobooks now queued across all series, the primary remaining work is monitoring download progress and investigating the 9 missing titles through manual searches or alternative sources.
