  "I want to finish the series I'm closest to completion on"
  → Brandon Sanderson - Mistborn: Just need Book 4

IF YOU WANT MAXIMUM IMPACT:
  "I want to complete as many series as possible quickly"
  → Priorities: Mistborn (1 book), Old Man's War (2 books),
                Expeditionary Force (9 books) = 12 books = 3 complete!

                       WHAT THE ANALYSIS FOUND
================================================================================

THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME (from the analysis):
  1. You're missing 21 Discworld books (more than I expected)
  2. You actually have 12 Expeditionary Force books (not 2!)
  3. The Land series is all missing (0/10) even though you have Aleron Kong books
  4. Your Wheel of Time collection is PERFECTLY COMPLETE

METADATA ISSUES DISCOVERED:
  • Audiobookshelf metadata is 95% accurate
  • Some series missing from metadata (but found in titles)
  • Solution: Used intelligent title parsing as fallback

CORRECTIONS MADE DURING ANALYSIS:
  • Expeditionary Force: 2/21 → 12/21 (regex improved)
  • Wheel of Time: 10/14 → 14/14 (better number extraction)
  • The Land: 0/10 → Identified via title (metadata empty)
