- ~33% of torrents on site are VIP-only
- Download VIP torrents = 0 bytes against ratio!

### 3. Freeleech Wedges
- Make individual torrents not count against download
- Use on large audiobooks

### 4. Other Options
- Seedtime fixes (buy out required 72 hours)

- Hide warning triangles

## 🏆 BEST RATIO STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Use Freeleech Options (RECOMMENDED)

**Priority Order for Downloads:**

1. **Staff Freeleech Picks** (https://www.myanonamouse.net/freeleech.php)
   - Marked with freeleech icon
   - **0 bytes download** - doesn't count against ratio AT ALL
   - Several hundred files from every category
   - **Download these first!**

2. **VIP-Only Torrents** (if you're VIP)
   - Marked with gold crown
   - **Always freeleech for VIP members**
   - 33%+ of all torrents
   - **Best value for VIP status**

3. **Use Freeleech Wedges** on large audiobooks
   - You have **110 wedges**
   - Apply to torrents before downloading
   - Makes that torrent freeleech for you

### Strategy 2: Continuous Seeding = Bonus Points

**Your Current Stats:**
- Earning **1,413.399 bonus points/hour**
- 836 torrents seeding
- Ratio: **4.053602** (excellent!)

**Optimization:**
- Keep seeding everything forever (you're doing this!)
- Points accumulate constantly
- Trade points for upload credit as needed
- At 99,999 cap, use points before earning more

### Strategy 3: Trade Bonus Points for Upload Credit

**When to Trade:**
- Your points are **MAXED at 99,999**
- Trade **NOW** to avoid wasting earned points
- Example: 99,999 points = **199.998 GB upload credit**

**How to Trade:**
- Go to: https://www.myanonamouse.net/store.php
- Click "Exchange points for Upload Credit"
- Trade in chunks (e.g., 50,000 points = 100 GB)

### Strategy 4: Smart Download Choices

**For Best Ratio:**

1. **Prefer smaller files first**
   - Build ratio with ebooks before audiobooks
   - Audiobooks are large (200-500 MB)
   - Ebooks are small (1-5 MB)

2. **Use freeleech for large downloads**
   - Staff picks
   - VIP torrents (if VIP)
   - Freeleech wedges for non-freeleech large files

3. **Download well-seeded torrents**
   - More seeders = upload faster
   - Build ratio quicker
