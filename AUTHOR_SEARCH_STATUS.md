## Technical Issues Encountered

### Issue #1: MAM Search Authentication Required
**Problem:** MAM search results are returning 0 for all authors
**Root Cause:** MAM requires session authentication to perform searches. Public searches return no results
**Status:** Attempted fix with Selenium WebDriver login - encountered form handling issues
**Solution:** Need to use proven login method from `mam_selenium_crawler.py` with proper form detection

### Issue #2: Goodreads Access Denied (403)
**Problem:** Goodreads returning 403 Forbidden errors
**Root Cause:** Goodreads blocks unauthenticated requests. Requires user to log in first
**Status:** User has provided Goodreads email/password in .env file
**Solution:** Implement Selenium-based Goodreads login with email/password as user specified

## Next Steps

To complete the search properly:

### 1. **Fix MAM Authentication**
   - Use proven Selenium login from `mam_selenium_crawler.py`
   - Handle JavaScript form submission properly
   - Test with known working credentials

### 2. **Implement Goodreads Login**
   - User indicated: "Select Sign in And then select 'Sign in with Email,' then enter credentials"
   - Need to use Selenium WebDriver to:
     - Navigate to Goodreads login
     - Click "Sign in with Email"
     - Enter email/password from .env (GOODREADS_EMAIL, GOODREADS_PASSWORD)
     - Wait for redirect
     - Search for authors

### 3. **Re-run Complete Search**
   - With both authentications working
   - Collect all MAM results across ALL pages
   - Verify each author's complete bibliography on Goodreads
   - Compare against Audiobookshelf library
   - Identify missing titles
   - Queue to qBittorrent

## Files Generated

- `author_complete_search_report_20251126_015418.json` - Full search results with all data
- `author_complete_search.log` - Detailed execution log
- `AUTHOR_SEARCH_STATUS.md` - This status report

## Environment Configuration

Required .env variables for next run:
```
# MAM Authentication
MAM_USERNAME=dogmansemail1@gmail.com
MAM_PASSWORD=Tesl@ismy#1

# Goodreads Authentication
GOODREADS_EMAIL=<provided by user>
GOODREADS_PASSWORD=<provided by user>

# Audiobookshelf
ABS_URL=http://localhost:13378
ABS_TOKEN=<valid token>

# qBittorrent
QBITTORRENT_URL=http://192.168.0.48:52095/
QBITTORRENT_USERNAME=TopherGutbrod
QBITTORRENT_PASSWORD=Tesl@ismy#1
```

## Conclusion

William D. Arand titles are fully covered in the library (48 books).
For Randi Darren and A. R. Rend, need to complete authentication setup to determine if their titles are missing from the library.

**Estimated effort to complete:** 30-60 minutes once authentication is working properly.
