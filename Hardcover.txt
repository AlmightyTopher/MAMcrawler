API Access
Our API is stil in the works, but you can experiment with it today. Here's a quick look at how.

Our API is accessible using GraphQL. The API that you can use is exactly the same API used by the website, iOS and Android apps.

To get stated, head over to the GraphQL console.

Next, add a header just called "authorization" (no quotes) with the following value:

Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJIYXJkY292ZXIiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoiOCIsImp0aSI6IjYyNGE3NGZlLTk5NzAtNDdmYi1hYjM3LTUyNzdkMTE0MGRmMCIsImFwcGxpY2F0aW9uSWQiOjIsInN1YiI6IjQ1OTA5IiwiYXVkIjoiMSIsImlkIjoiNDU5MDkiLCJsb2dnZWRJbiI6dHJ1ZSwiaWF0IjoxNzY0NDEwMDY3LCJleHAiOjE3OTU5NDYwNjcsImh0dHBzOi8vaGFzdXJhLmlvL2p3dC9jbGFpbXMiOnsieC1oYXN1cmEtYWxsb3dlZC1yb2xlcyI6WyJ1c2VyIl0sIngtaGFzdXJhLWRlZmF1bHQtcm9sZSI6InVzZXIiLCJ4LWhhc3VyYS1yb2xlIjoidXNlciIsIlgtaGFzdXJhLXVzZXItaWQiOiI0NTkwOSJ9LCJ1c2VyIjp7ImlkIjo0NTkwOX19.5k8tmy2uz0JVbcxEIpn3MGWun0M6ZWC6Tnhj8ekHNkI
Tab out of the field, and you'll be able to see a list of all endpoints!

To test that it's working, try the following GraphQL query

query Test {
    me {
      username
    }
  }
Click the play button and you should see your username!

This token has a 1-year expiration time from the moment you loaded this page. Hopefully (🤞) we'll have a better API to use by then with more concrete instructions.

A Few Notes
This token will work for 1 year from today. After that, you'll need to regenerate it. The exact expiration date is 11/29/2026, 1:54:27 AM.
The API is still heavily in flux right now. Anything you build using it could break in the future.
We may reset tokens without notice while in beta.
The same ownership rights exist for this as anything on the site. You own your data. This means you can't use the API to access and use someone elses data.
This API is running the same as if you were using the browser. Any actions you take will be under your user.
Don't share your token! Someone could delete your account with it.
This should only be used from a code backend - never from a browser.
Later on we'll get some better documentation, don't worry. 😉
