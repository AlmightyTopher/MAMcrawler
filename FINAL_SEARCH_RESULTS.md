## Why No MAM Results?

The script searches MAM using requests (HTTP client) without JavaScript execution. MAM may require:
- Advanced JavaScript rendering
- Session cookies with special authentication
- Browser-like headers and behavior

**Solutions:**
1. **Manual MAM Search:** Go to https://www.myanonamouse.net/tor/browse.php and search directly
2. **Use mam_selenium_crawler.py:** This script has proven JavaScript handling for MAM logins
3. **Use Goodreads data:** Since Goodreads shows ~10 books per author, you can manually search those
